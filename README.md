# Animated-Navigation-Template
Template website built to practice animated menus

# Inspiration:
The project was built following JavaScript Web Projects: 20 Projects to Build Your Portfolio - from the Zero to Mastery Academy and was my first time building out an animated hamburger menu

# What I learned:
The project is built entirely with HTML + CSS + JavaScript and helped shift my perspective away from being React centric to realizing what is actually possible with the basics.
